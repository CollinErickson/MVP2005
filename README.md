This GitHub repo provides PS2 memory cards that have updated rosters
for MVP Baseball 2005.

This will only work for the PS2 version of MVP Baseball 2005, not for other
platforms or games.

## Instructions (advanced)

Download the latest memory card from releases page.
The memory card contains a roster file that you should load.

## Instructions (beginner)

### Using PCSX2 emulator for Windows/Linux:

1. Download and install PCSX2.

2. Legally acquire the PS2 bios and a copy of MVP Baseball 2005 for PS2.
Put these both in the proper folders.

3. Download the latest memory card file from the Releases tab on this page.
Put this file in the memory card folder for PCSX2. In PCSX2, open the memory
card settings, and put the memory card in one of the two slots.

4. Start the game. Navigate to the Rosters option and then Load Rosters.

### Using PS2

I haven't tried this. If you get this to work, let me know what steps you
did and I'll put it here.

## FAQs

### I'm confused. What am I supposed to do?

See the Instructions (Beginner) above. You don't need all the files in this
repo, you only download a single file from the Releases page.

### How can I contribute?

If you see any issues, report it on the
[Issues tab](https://github.com/CollinErickson/MVP2005/issues)
above.

If you are enjoying it, let me know by starring this repo or sending me an 
email.

### Will there be future updates?

### How can I be notified about future updates?

On this page, click on "Watch", then "Custom", then check "Releases" and 
click apply. You should receive an email when there is a new release.
(I have never actually tried this, correct me if I'm wrong.)

### Why are the players from 2005 on the Free Agent list with horrible stats?

The old players can't be deleted. The best option is to make them horrible
and leave them on the Free Agent list.


## Known issues

* No heatmaps

* No 2-seamers (need a better data source)

* No rare pitches (a few pitchers should have knuckleball, screwball, forkball)

* Better calibration of the attributes. E.g., maybe there are too many/few
hitters with contact v LHP over 90. (Need help identifying these.)

* Better attribute values (a lot seem weird)
