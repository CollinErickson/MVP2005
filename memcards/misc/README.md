* **Nerf**: Roster file, players have all been reduced to be awful. Players
remain on their original rosters.

## MVP05Rosters-Zero.ps2

* **Zero**: Roster file, players have all been reduced to be awful. Players
remain on their original rosters. All editable players have been set to the
same values so that future roster creations can use them and not need to use
OCR to determine the starting values. Editable players were given 5 stars for
Career Potential and all editable hitters were given 25 for contact v RHP to
ensure that all editable players appear above uneditable players in the Free
Agent list. This way I can edit the top Free Agent (using **ZeroFA** memory
card) and not have to worry about
getting stuck at uneditable players (or at least only a few will get in the
way).

* **ZeroFA**: The same players as on **Zero**, but all have been moved to
the Free Agent list.
